# Global disease & mortality - Analysis of 30 years of Indonesia's data
![Global_Mortality](https://github.com/harishmuh/Global_Mortality_Indonesia/blob/main/global_mortality_illustration.png?raw=true)

## Context
Global healthcare expenditure has steadily increased, with countries allocating substantial portions (5â€“12%) of their GDP to healthcare (IPSOS, 2023 & IHME, 2013). Like many other nations, Indonesia faces the challenge of balancing rising healthcare costs with effective public health interventions. Indonesia's healthcare budget is projected to increase by 8.1% in 2024, reaching IDR 184.6 trillion compared to the previous year (Indonesia's Ministry of Health, 2023).

However, questions arise: Has rising healthcare expenditure improved the population health of the nation? Is the allocation of funding for healthcare and public health in line with objectives and priorities? Are there alternative metrics to guide better decisions?

It's difficult to answer these questions directly.  However, insights might be found by examining global mortality data, as these data potentially represent population health. Interestingly, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), quantifies health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors worldwide. By analyzing global mortality trends, we can obtain useful insights into the factors and dominant causes of mortality. This is crucial for the Indonesian government in prioritizing funding and formulating evidence-based policies. Additionally, the healthcare industry can gain insights from these trends to identify opportunities for providing solutions.

## Questions
Through this data analysis project, we aim to answer the following question:  What are the key insights and recommendations that can be obtained from global mortality cause data to improve the population health of Indonesia?

## Data Source
The raw data were obtained from the website of [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death). The data were collected by IHME, at the University of Washington, in collaboration with international health organizations like WHO.

* 1990-1999: Heart diseases remained the leading cause of mortality, followed by tuberculosis and cancers.

* 2010-2019: While heart diseases and cancers remained prevalent, tuberculosis mortality rates declined, however diabetes and chronic lung conditions are rising to the top 5

* While in global situation, Non-communicable (non infectious) diseases is dominating the trend rather than infectious diseases.
* In contrast, Indonesia's 30-year mortality profile differs from the global pattern, with significant contributions from communicable diseases alongside non-communicable diseases. While non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular diseases and cancers are present, communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diarrheal diseases play a more significant role in Indonesia.




## Recommendations
### Recommendations for The Public Health Policy Formulator:
* Leverage data for evidence-based policies and interventions.
* Prioritize funding and resources toward addressing prevalent causes such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Implement prevention, early detection, and treatment.
* Implement preventive measures and awareness campaigns to reduce the burden of diseases like Tuberculosis and diarrheal diseases.
* Strengthen healthcare infrastructure to improve access to quality healthcare services.

### Recommendations for the Health Industry
* Develop affordable and effective treatments for prevalent diseases.
* Research and innovate in diagnostics and therapies for Tuberculosis and digestive diseases.
* Collaborate with government initiatives to improve healthcare access and delivery across Indonesia.

### Call to Action
* Individuals: Practice healthy lifestyles, seek preventive healthcare, and advocate for improved healthcare access.
* Governments: Utilize data for evidence-based policymaking, prioritize funding for prevalent diseases, and strengthen healthcare infrastructure.
* Healthcare Industry: Invest in research and development of affordable treatments and collaborate with governments on public health initiatives.
* Communities: Raise awareness about health challenges and promote healthy behaviors within communities.
